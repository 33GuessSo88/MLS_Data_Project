        "     - Spelling variations (e.g., \"Chateaux Strathcona\" → \"Chateau Strathcona\").\n",

        "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
        "   - Cleans and prepares condo names by removing null values, converting to strings, and stripping whitespace.\n",
        "   - Logs basic statistics (total properties, valid names, unique condo names).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Pattern Analysis**:\n",
        "   - Identifies **sequential buildings** (e.g., \"Building 1\" and \"Building 2\") using regex patterns.\n",
        "   - Detects **spelling variations** (e.g., \"Chateau\" vs. \"Chateaux\") using string similarity.\n",
        "   - Flags **similar but different buildings** (e.g., \"Oak Place\" vs. \"Oak Pointe\") based on similarity ratios and common indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Results**:\n",
        "   - Logs sequential buildings, spelling variations, and similar but different buildings.\n",
        "   - Provides detailed insights into naming patterns and potential standardization opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features**:\n",
        "- **Sequential Building Detection**: Identifies buildings that are part of the same complex (e.g., phases or numbered buildings).\n",
        "- **Spelling Variation Detection**: Finds and logs spelling inconsistencies in condo names.\n",
        "- **Similarity Analysis**: Highlights buildings with similar names but distinct identities.\n",
        "- **Logging**: Tracks the analysis process and results using the `NotebookLogger` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Future Enhancements**:\n",
        "- Automate the standardization of sequential buildings and spelling variations.\n",
        "- Expand the analysis to include additional naming patterns (e.g., abbreviations, acronyms).\n",
        "- Integrate with a data validation pipeline to ensure ongoing consistency.\n",

        "# Condo Complex Grouping System\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This code block creates and manages a grouping system for related condo buildings within larger complexes. It's crucial for proper real estate analysis as it helps identify units that are part of the same development, even if they have slightly different names (e.g., phases, numbered buildings).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Details\n",
        "### Input\n",
        "* DataFrame containing standardized condo data\n",
        "* Required column: 'Condo_Name'\n",
        "* Current scale: Handles entire MLS dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output\n",
        "* Original DataFrame with new 'Condo_Complex' column\n",
        "* Complex statistics in log file\n",
        "* Detailed building distribution analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Operations\n",
        "1. Input Validation\n",
        "   * Verifies DataFrame format\n",
        "   * Checks for required columns\n",
        "   * Handles null values safely\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Complex Mapping\n",
        "   * Uses dictionary to map buildings to complexes\n",
        "   * Handles case sensitivity\n",
        "   * Preserves original names when no mapping exists\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Analysis Generation\n",
        "   * Calculates complex-level statistics\n",
        "   * Analyzes building distributions\n",
        "   * Computes unit percentages per building\n",
        "\n",
        "## Code Review Findings\n",
        "1. Potential Issues:\n",
        "   * The complex_mapping dictionary is hardcoded - consider moving to external configuration\n",
        "   * No validation for duplicate mappings\n",
        "   * Missing handling for edge cases (e.g., similar names but different complexes)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Suggested Improvements:\n",
        "   * Add validation for complex names before mapping\n",
        "   * Implement fuzzy matching for similar names\n",
        "   * Add option to export mapping dictionary for review\n",
        "   * Consider adding validation for geographical proximity\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pipeline Implications\n",
        "This standardization step is crucial because:\n",
        "1. It affects all downstream complex-level analyses\n",
        "2. Impacts Power BI visualizations grouping\n",
        "3. Influences statistical calculations by complex\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "After running this code:\n",
        "1. Verify complex groupings are accurate\n",
        "2. Review any unmapped buildings\n",
        "3. Consider geographical validation\n",
        "4. Update Power BI relationships\n",

        "\n",
        "This code block is the heart of your machine learning pipeline for predicting `Condo_Name`. It takes your prepared features (`X`) and target variable (`y`) and trains a robust Random Forest classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of this block is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Train a Machine Learning Model**: Specifically, a `RandomForestClassifier`, to accurately predict the `Condo_Name` based on the features you engineered.\n",
        "2.  **Evaluate Robustly**: Use **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** to get a reliable estimate of the model's performance across different subsets of your data, ensuring the results aren't just \"lucky\" for one split.\n",
        "3.  **Optimize Performance**: Optionally run **Hyperparameter Tuning (Randomized Search)** to automatically find the best combination of model settings for your specific dataset, maximizing accuracy and generalization.\n",
        "4.  **Enable Reusability**: **Save the trained model and its optimal parameters** to your Google Drive, so you only have to run the computationally intensive tuning process *once*. For monthly updates, you can then load the pre-tuned parameters and just train the model quickly.\n",
        "5.  **Address Imbalance**: Use `class_weight='balanced'` in the Random Forest to improve performance on condo names with fewer historical sales.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **How to Use This Block**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Ensure Prerequisites**:\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Make sure all previous data loading, cleaning, and **Feature Engineering and Training Matrix Preparation** blocks have been run successfully. This block relies on the `X` (feature matrix) and `y` (target variable) DataFrames being present in your Colab environment.\n",

        "      * A `WARNING` about the long runtime.\n",
        "      * Progress updates from `RandomizedSearchCV`.\n",
        "      * A summary table showing the `Best F1-Macro Score (CV)`, `Tuning Duration`, and the `Best Parameters Found`.\n",
        "      * This is what you'll **copy and paste into your `DEFAULT_MODEL_PARAMS` or load from the saved JSON file** for future runs.\n",
        "  * **Cross-Validation Results**:\n",
        "      * A summary table showing the `Mean Score` and `Std Dev` for Accuracy, F1-Macro, and F1-Weighted across all `N_FOLDS_CV` folds. This is your most reliable estimate of how well your model generalizes.\n",
        "      * This step always runs, providing consistent performance monitoring.\n",
        "  * **Final Model Training**: Confirmation that the final model is being trained on your entire dataset using the chosen parameters.\n",
        "  * **Model Saving (If `SAVE_MODEL_AND_PARAMS` is `True`)**: Confirmation of where the model and parameters are saved in your Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Learning Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Reproducibility (`RANDOM_STATE`)**: Notice how `random_state` is consistently used throughout for splits and model initialization. This ensures that your results are reproducible.\n",
        "  * **Class Imbalance (`class_weight='balanced'`)**: This parameter is vital for multi-class classification where some categories have many more samples than others. It helps the model learn from less frequent condo names.\n",
        "  * **Cross-Validation Power**: By seeing average performance across multiple folds, you get a much more trustworthy picture of your model's real-world effectiveness than from a single train/test split.\n",
        "  * **Tuning for Performance**: Hyperparameter tuning systematically explores different model configurations to find the sweet spot for your data.\n",
        "  * **Model Persistence for Efficiency**: Once tuned, saving and loading the model and its parameters saves massive amounts of time on subsequent runs. You've effectively separated the \"optimization\" phase from the \"operational\" phase of your pipeline.\n",

        "## Understanding the Date Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "This code performs two crucial operations that work together like a sophisticated date management system. Let me explain why each part matters and how they work together.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Analysis Phase\n",
        "The `analyze_date_columns` function works like a thorough date inspector. Imagine you're examining a collection of historical documents - you want to make sure all the dates make logical sense and follow a proper timeline. This function does exactly that for our real estate data by:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Checking Date Types and Formats**:\n",
        "   Just as we might find dates written in different styles (like \"January 1, 2024\" or \"01/01/2024\"), this function identifies how our dates are currently stored in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Validating Date Sequences**:\n",
        "   In real estate transactions, events must happen in a logical order - you can't purchase a house before it's listed, and you can't close before purchasing. The function verifies these logical sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Identifying Suspicious Dates**:\n",
        "   Just as we might question a document dated \"2025\" or \"1890\" in a modern real estate transaction, this function flags dates that seem unreasonable:\n",
        "   - Future dates that haven't happened yet\n",
        "   - Very old dates that predate modern real estate practices (before 1980)\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Conversion Phase\n",
        "The `convert_dates_for_power_bi` function acts like a date standardization expert. After we understand what issues exist in our dates, this function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Creates Consistent Formats**:\n",
        "   Converts all dates to a standard datetime format that Power BI can understand and work with effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handles Errors Gracefully**:\n",
        "   If it encounters dates it can't convert, it marks them as null rather than failing or creating invalid data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maintains Data Quality**:\n",
        "   Keeps track of how many dates couldn't be converted, helping us understand our data quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters for Our Pipeline\n",
        "This date standardization step is crucial because:\n",
        "- Proper date formats enable time-based analysis in Power BI\n",
        "- Consistent date formats prevent visualization errors\n",
        "- Validated date sequences ensure accurate transaction timeline analysis\n",
        "- Clean date data enables reliable trend analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "After this standardization, our `combined_data` will have properly formatted dates ready for:\n",
        "1. Timeline visualizations in Power BI\n",
        "2. Sales trend analysis\n",
        "3. Seasonal pattern identification\n",
        "4. Transaction duration calculations\n",
        "\n",
        "Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail? For instance, I could elaborate on how the date validation works or why certain date formats are better for Power BI."
